Query->OData Agent-> XML Response -> (Dataframe) -> Display (Display entire CDS view)                                                 
                                              if(Field Selection Required for user query)?    
                                                 -> Select Fields for Display -> Insights 
                                                 -> Select Fields for Display -> Chart Generation



Insights:
   Dataframe from the user -> We can provide column mappings -> You can use tool calling for aggregated columns -> Generate insight based on that for calculation 

   Prompt = You are provided a list of list of data, and mappings for that particular data {for key in key:value}
      You will create a new dataframe based on the selection of user query and criteria. Once you have decided, you have access to tools 
      call_data which you can use to extract the information.   


Three Agents 
      First one would be for reasoining-> reasoining would be passed onto the code generator, also provide the location for the dataframe for it to load -> REPL Environement agent which would run the code, and produce the output in human readable format
      -> Output State?


      API:
         Get 
         -insight_generation(dataframe_location, prompt, ConversationManager()):
         


      Agents:
         Reasoning Agent (System prompt, personal_agent_prompt, dataframe_mappings)
         Code Generator (System prompt, personal_agent_prompt, dataframe_location) [Generate Code from where the dataframe is located] ->REPL Tool
